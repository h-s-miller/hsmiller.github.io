1. [Mouseome](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/174976/pdf) (or rather, PhIP-squeak :mouse:): 
  - This paper documents the first full proteome mouse peptide library for PhIP-seq, which was created and validated in our lab. We found significant structual properties of autoimmunity on the autoantibody repertoire in several mouse models. We expect this tool to be very useful for autoimmune researchers preforming mouse experiments.
  My contribution to this paper was building all of the analysis tools used and preforming motif analysis on OB1 mice.
2. [Molecular mimicry in Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.26.23290373v1.full)
  - In this paper it was shown that children with MIS-C had cross-reactivity to a distinct domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and SNX8 in both antibody and T-cell responses. Using publically available scRNA-seq data, I found that SNX8 and other genes in the SNX8 opathway are expressed in immune cells and upregulated in asymptomatic COVID-19 and Flu infection.

1. [Extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) support maternal-fetal tolerance](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abf1968)
- This research found that maternal-fetal tolerance is supported by eTACs, as ablation of Aire-expressing cells in teh periphery resulted in intrauterine fetal growth restriction. I analyzed scRNA-seq data from aire-ablated pregnant mice and found a shift in the T cell populations away from T-regulatory cells and towards T-follicular helper cells, implying a loss in tolerance without eTACs.
