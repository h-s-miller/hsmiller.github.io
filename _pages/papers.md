1. [Autoantibody signature of preterm birth](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.03.24314850v1.full)
   - In this paper, it was found that preterm birth has a distinct autoantibody signature to term birth. Within the autoantibody signature, anti-Il1ra antibodies were found in 10% of preterm births. In mouse experiments, these autoantibodies were found to cause vascular abnormalities and resporption in pregnant mice. My contribution to this paper was building the analysis tools used to analyze PhIP-seq data. 
  
2. [Molecular mimicry in Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07722-4)
  - In this paper it was shown that children with MIS-C had cross-reactivity to a distinct domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and SNX8 in both antibody and T-cell responses. Using publically available scRNA-seq data, I found that SNX8 and other genes in the SNX8 pathway are expressed in immune cells and upregulated in asymptomatic COVID-19 and Flu infections.
    
3. [Mouseome](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/174976/pdf) (or rather, PhIP-squeak :mouse:): 
  - This paper documents a proteome-wide mouse peptide library for PhIP-seq, which was created and validated in our lab. We found significant structual properties of autoimmunity on the autoantibody repertoire in several mouse models. We expect this tool to be very useful for autoimmune researchers preforming mouse experiments. My contribution to this paper was building all of the analysis tools used and preforming motif analysis on OB1 mice.

1. [Extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) support maternal-fetal tolerance](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abf1968)
- This research found that maternal-fetal tolerance is supported by eTACs, as ablation of Aire-expressing cells in the periphery resulted in intrauterine fetal growth restriction. I analyzed scRNA-seq data from aire-ablated pregnant mice and found a shift in the T cell populations away from T-regulatory cells and towards T-follicular helper cells, implying a loss in tolerance without eTACs.
