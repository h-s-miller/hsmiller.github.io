I build software for PhIP-seq experimental design and analysis. I have a few WIP: 
1. [Platemappy](https://github.com/h-s-miller/platemappy)
   - a tool for designing and optimizing 96-well platemaps that randomize samples to avoid local batch effect.
3. [Phagepy](https://github.com/h-s-miller/phagepy)
  - a toolbox for PhIP-seq data pre-processing and analysis.
