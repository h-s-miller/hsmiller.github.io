I am a PhD candidate in the Biological and Medical Informatics program at UCSF doing research in the [DeRisi Lab](https://derisilab.ucsf.edu/). Prior to joining UCSF, I studied Math and Scientific Computation at UCD. In lab, I bridge computational and wet lab science to study autoimmunity and antibodies.

My research goals are to create a circular ecosystem between computation and the bench: build tools that make experiments easier --> run experiments --> build analysis tools to generate hypotheses from my experiments --> plan more experiments to test these hypotheses!

Currently, I study autoantibody repertoires in Vasculitis and Traumatic Brain Injury using Phage-immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-seq).
